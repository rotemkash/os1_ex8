This program defines in a shared memory an array of integers.
To the first cell he enters his id. 
Then he goes to sleep until he gets a signal and then he shows 
how many different values there are in the array, what is the
smallest value and what is the largest value.

Compile: gcc -Wall -o ex8a1 -l pthread ex8a1.c

Run: ex8a1

This program Log in to the shared memory assigned by the ex8a1
program. The program will run in a loop. each round in a loop The
program produces a number if it is prime it adds it to the array 
in the shared memory. She counts how many new values she added.
Finally she prints how many new values she added to the array

Compile: gcc -Wall -o ex8a2 -l pthread ex8a2.c

Run: ex8a2 1
(and respectively 2 for the second copy and 3 for the third copy)

race modes:i don't find any race modes

 The program defines a global array of 1000 cells. 
 The main thread: the array owner
 It creates 3 threads and then it waits for them and when they finish it means 
 that the array is full and  then it shows how many values ​​have been added to
 the array and which are the maximum and the minimum.
 Three Sub threads: Prime Number Producers
 Each thread draws a random number and tries to add it to the array.
 For the test + addition: the thread lock the semaphore and thereby 
 gain (this time: for real) the right to scan the array alone. Finally he releases the semaphore.
 If a thread found all the cells of the array full (or it failed a hundred times
 in a row to add a new value) it print how many new primes he added to the array and finish.
 Only one thread print after filling the array the output done,this will happen with the
 pthread_once mechanism.

Compile: gcc -Wall -lpthread ex8b.c -o ex8b

Run: ex8b
